# Call Stack and Memory Heap

The JavaScript engine does a lot of work for us, but **two of the biggest jobs** are:
- **Reading the code**
- **Executing the code**

To do this efficiently, JavaScript uses:
- The **Memory Heap** ‚Äì to store and write data
- The **Call Stack** ‚Äì to keep track of what‚Äôs executing, line by line

---

## üß† Memory Heap

The **Memory Heap** is:
- A place to store and write information
- Used to **allocate, use, and remove memory** as needed
- **Unordered**, like a storage room full of random boxes

  # üìû Call Stack

The **call stack** keeps track of **where we are in the code** so that the program can execute in the correct order.

### Key Points:
- Things are **pushed to the top** of the stack when a function is called.
- They are **popped off** the stack when the function completes.
- It operates in **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** order.
- Each item in the call stack can **reference a location in the memory heap**.

### Example: Memory Allocation

```javascript
// Tell the memory heap to allocate memory for a number
const number = 11;

// Allocate memory for a string
const string = "some text";

// Allocate memory for an object and its values
const person = {
  first: "Brittney",
  last: "Postma"
};


## üîÅ Example: Call Stack in Action

```javascript
function subtractTwo(num) {
  return num - 2;
}

function calculate() {
  const sumTotal = 4 + 5;
  return subtractTwo(sumTotal);
}

debugger;
calculate();
