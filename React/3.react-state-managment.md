# Section 4: State Management (Study Notes)

---

## 1. React Query

- React Query manages **server state** (API data) in React.
- Handles fetching, caching, background refetching and synchronization.
- Removes manual useEffect + fetch + loading/error handling.
- Avoids unnecessary network calls with caching & stale data.
- Improves UX in dashboards, feeds, lists, infinite scroll.
- Works great with REST + GraphQL.

**Example:**
```jsx
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery(['users'], fetchUsers);
```

## 2. How Redux Works in Plain JavaScript

- Redux is a predictable state container using a single store.
- State updates only through actions and reducers.
- Reducers are pure functions returning new state.
- Store updates via `dispatch(action)`.
- Helps debugging and enables time-travel devtools.

**Example:**
```js
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
```

## 42. How Redux Works with React

- `Provider` makes store available to the component tree.
- `useSelector` reads state from store.
- `useDispatch` dispatches actions to update state.
- Useful when many components need shared data.

**Example:**
```jsx
const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
```

## 43. How Redux Toolkit Works

- Redux Toolkit (RTK) reduces boilerplate and complexity.
- `createSlice()` generates actions + reducers automatically.
- Uses Immer for immutable state updates behind the scenes.
- Comes with pre-configured store, middleware & devtools.
- Official recommended way to write Redux today.

**Example:**
```js
const slice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    inc: state => { state.count += 1; }
  }
});
```
