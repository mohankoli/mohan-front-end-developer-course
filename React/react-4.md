# React – State, Data & Patterns (Interview Notes)

---

## 1. What is `useReducer` and when do you prefer it over `useState`?

### useReducer

`useReducer` is a React hook used for **complex state logic** where state transitions depend on actions.

### Prefer `useReducer` when:

* State has **multiple sub-values**
* State updates depend on **previous state**
* You want **predictable state transitions**
* Managing complex forms or workflows

### Example

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "DECREMENT":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case "RESET":
      return { count: 0 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}


function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Count: {state.count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" })}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "RESET" })}>Reset</button>
    </>
  );
}

```

## 2. How do you decide between local state and global state?

### Local State

Use when:

* State is used by **single component**
* UI-specific state (modal, input, toggle)

### Global State

Use when:

* State is shared across **multiple screens**
* App-wide concerns (auth, theme, user)

### Rule of Thumb

> Keep state **as close as possible** to where it is used.

# 🌟 Local State vs Global State (React)

## Simple & Interview-Friendly Decision Table

| 🔍 Decision Criteria | 🧩 Local State (`useState`, `useReducer`) | 🌍 Global State (Context API, Redux) |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Scope** | Single component or small tree | Multiple unrelated components |
| **Sharing needed?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **State type** | UI state (forms, modals, toggles) | App-wide / business data |
| **Complexity** | Simple to moderately complex | Medium to highly complex |
| **Update frequency** | Low to medium | Medium to high |
| **Logic handling** | `useState` (simple), `useReducer` (complex) | Context (simple), Redux (complex) |
| **Prop drilling issue** | ❌ Not an issue | ✅ Avoided |
| **Performance impact** | Minimal | Needs optimization |
| **Debugging tools** | Basic | Advanced (Redux DevTools) |
| **Scalability** | Limited | High |
| **Best examples** | Input value, modal open/close | Auth, cart, theme, permissions |

## 🧠 Easy Memory Rule

```
UI-only → Local State  
Shared → Global State  
Simple → Context  
Complex → Redux
```

## 🎯 One-Line Interview Answer

> I keep state as local as possible using `useState` or `useReducer`. When state needs to be shared across components, I use Context API for simple cases and Redux for complex, frequently changing global state.

## 3. Context API vs Redux — how do you decide?

### Context API

* Good for **low-frequency updates**
* Avoids prop drilling
* Simple setup

### Redux

* Best for **large-scale applications**
* Predictable state flow
* Time-travel debugging

### Decision

* Small app → Context API
* Large app with frequent updates → Redux

  # Context API vs Redux (Decision Matrix)

| Criteria          | Context API                      | Redux                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| App size          | Small to Medium                  | Medium to Large              |
| Update frequency  | Low                              | High                         |
| State complexity  | Simple                           | Complex                      |
| Debugging         | Limited                          | Excellent                    |
| Boilerplate       | Low                              | Moderate                     |
| Learning curve    | Easy                             | Steep                        |
| Performance       | May cause unnecessary re-renders | Optimized with selectors     |
| Async handling    | Manual handling                  | Built-in via middleware      |
| DevTools support  | Minimal                          | Excellent (Redux DevTools)   |
| Testing           | Simple but less structured       | Predictable and structured   |
| Typical use cases | Theme, auth info, locale         | Cart, auth flows, dashboards |
| Scalability       | Limited                          | High                         |

## Interview Summary

Use **Context API** for simple, low-frequency global data.
Use **Redux** for complex, frequently changing, business-critical state that needs scalability and debugging.



---

## 4. How do you handle forms at scale in React?

### Recommended Approaches

* Controlled components
* Form libraries (React Hook Form, Formik)
* Validation schemas (Yup / Zod)

### Example (React Hook Form)

```js
const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();
```

### Why libraries?

* Better performance
* Less re-renders
* Built-in validation

---

## 5. How do you share data between sibling or deeply nested components?

### Options

* Lifting state up
* Context API
* Global state (Redux / Zustand)

### Example (Lifting State)

```js
<Parent>
  <ChildA value={value} />
  <ChildB setValue={setValue} />
</Parent>
```

---

## 6. How do you manage derived state correctly?

### Derived State

State that can be **calculated from existing state or props**.

### Best Practice

* Do NOT store derived state
* Compute it using `useMemo`

### Example

```js
const total = useMemo(() => price * qty, [price, qty]);
```

---

## 7. What are the benefits of immutability in React?

### Benefits

* Enables change detection
* Improves performance
* Predictable updates
* Works well with memoization

### Example

```js
setItems([...items, newItem]); // immutable
```

---

## 8. Common React anti-patterns seen in real projects

### Anti-patterns ❌

* Storing derived state
* Overusing `useEffect`
* Mutating state directly
* Using index as key
* Overusing Context
* Premature optimization

### Good Practice ✅

> Prefer simplicity, predictability, and colocated state.
