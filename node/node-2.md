- **How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations**
  - Node.js uses **callback functions**, **Promises**, and **async/await** to handle asynchronous tasks.
  - These mechanisms allow Node.js to **continue running other code** while waiting for the asynchronous operation to finish.
  - This makes Node.js **non-blocking** and **efficient** for handling many tasks at the same time.
