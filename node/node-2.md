- **How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations**
  - Node.js uses **callback functions**, **Promises**, and **async/await** to handle asynchronous tasks.
  - These mechanisms allow Node.js to **continue running other code** while waiting for the asynchronous operation to finish.
  - This makes Node.js **non-blocking** and **efficient**
  -  for handling many tasks at the same time.
 
- **What is a Callback Function in Node.js**
  - A **callback function** is a function passed as an **argument** to another function.
  - It is **called** once the **asynchronous operation** has completed.
  - Callbacks allow Node.js to **perform tasks without blocking** the main thread.
  - Commonly used for tasks like **reading files, network requests, or database operations**.
