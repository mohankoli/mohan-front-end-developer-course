- **How do you handle errors in Node.js**
  - Errors in Node.js can be handled using **try/catch blocks**.
  - **Error-first callbacks** are used where the first argument is an error object.
  - **Promises** handle errors using the **`.catch()`** method.
  - **async/await** handles errors using **try/catch** blocks.
  - The **`util.promisify()`** utility converts callback-based functions into Promises for easier error handling.

- **What is Express.js and why is it used**
  - **Express.js** is a **web application framework** for Node.js.
  - It simplifies building **APIs and web applications**.
  - Used to handle:
    - **HTTP requests and responses**
    - **Routing**
    - **Middleware**
  - Helps **speed up development** and keeps code **clean and structured**
  
- **What is middleware in Express.js**
  - Middleware is a **function** that runs **between the request and the response**.
  - It has access to:
    - **Request object (`req`)**
    - **Response object (`res`)**
    - **Next function (`next`)**
  - Middleware can:
    - **Modify request or response**
    - **Handle authentication**
    - **Log requests**
    - **Handle errors**
  - Calls **`next()`** to pass control to the next middleware.
 
- **How do you handle file uploads in Node.js**
  - File uploads are handled using **third-party packages**.
  - Commonly used packages:
    - **multer**
    - **formidable**
  - These packages:
    - Read file data using **streams**
    - Prevent loading the entire file into memory
  - Used mainly with **Express.js** for handling multipart/form-data.
  - Suitable for uploading files like **images, documents, and videos**.

- **What are Streams in Node.js**
  - Streams are **objects** that allow reading or writing data **continuously**.
  - Data is processed in **small chunks**, not all at once.
  - This makes them **memory-efficient**, especially for **large data**.
  - Common use cases:
    - Reading large files
    - Writing large files
    - Handling file uploads/downloads
  - Examples of streams:
    - **Readable**
    - **Writable**
    - **Duplex**
    - **Transform**
